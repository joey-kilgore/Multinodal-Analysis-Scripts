## Source Files
Multiple files are loaded for this markdown document. Each has its own use, and were built with modularity, and meant to be taken apart, and tinkered with.

#### UsefulFunctions.R
This is a conglomeration of functions that are useful while analyzing data from the [Nerve-Block-Modeling Repository](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/Nerve-Block-Modeling/). Notably there are functions for loading entire sets of .csv files, and putting them into one dataframe.

#### 3DVoltage.R
Generates 3D voltage plots showing the voltage of multiple nodes over time.

#### VoltageProfile.R
Generate plot of all node voltage values at a given time.

#### StateSpace.R
Generate a 3D plot showing voltage, m gate, h gate.

#### defs.R
Keeps track of certain parameters (notably the dataset directory), which are used by multiple source files.

## 3D Voltage Plots  
3D voltage plots allow showing voltage of multiple nodes over time. Unfortunately, 3d graphs are notorious for making some data hard to see.  
Regardless, they are a useful tool, and the following graph is an example of how they can show block. The following article is a reference to one of the earlier examples of this graphing technique.

Simulation Analysis of Nerve Block by High Frequency Biphasic Electrical Current Based on Frankenhaeuser-Huxley Model. 2005 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology 27th Annual Conference. doi: 10.1109/iembs.2005.1615402](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16200764)

```{r voltage3d, results='hide'}
voltagePlot3D()
```

## Voltage Profile Plots
Voltage profile plots give a method for observing the voltage of all nodes in a simulation. This is essentially a slice of the 3D voltage plot shown above, but showing all nodes instead of just a few. The following article is a reference to one of the earlier examples of this graphing technique.

```{r voltageProfile, results='hide'}
voltageProfile()
```

## State Space 3D Plot
State space plots allow for comparing the variables that build the system of equations within the model. The following article is a referecne to an example of this graphing technique.
